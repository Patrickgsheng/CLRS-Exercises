We can express insertion sort as a recursive procedure as follows.  In order to
sort A[1..n], we recursively sort A[1..n-1] and then insert A[n] into the
sorted array A[1..n-1].  Write a recurrence for the worst-case running time of
this recursive version of insertion sort.

T(n) =
    1               if n = 1
    T(n-1) + n      if n > 1
