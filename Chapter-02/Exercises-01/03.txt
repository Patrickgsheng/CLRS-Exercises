Consider the "searching problem":

Input: A sequence of n numbers A = 〈a₁, a₂, ..., aₙ 〉 and a value v.

Output: An index i such that v = A[i] or the special value NIL if v does not
appear in A.

Write pseudocode for linear search, which scans through the sequence, looking
for v.  Using a loop invariant proove that your algorithm is correct.  Make
sure that your loop invariant fulfills the three necessary properties.


LINEAR_SEARCH(A, v)
    for i = 1 to A.length
        if A[i] == v
            return i
    return NIL

At the start of each iteration of the for loop the first i-1 elements of A have
been checked against v.
