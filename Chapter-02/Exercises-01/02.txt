Rewrite the INSERTION-SORT procedure to sort into nonincreasing instead of non-
decreasing order.

This is simple.  All that was required was to change the comparison of
A[i] to the key from > to <

for j = 2 to A.length
    key = A[j]
    // Insert A[j] into the sorted sequence A[1..j-1].
    i = j - 1
    while i > 0 and A[i] < key
        A[i + 1] = A[i]
        i = i - 1
    A[i + 1] = key
