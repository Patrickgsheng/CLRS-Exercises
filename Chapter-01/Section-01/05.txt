Come up with a real-world problem in which only the best solution will do.  Then
come up with one in which a solution that is "approximately" the best is good
enough.

Going back to the traveling-salesman and shortest-path problems, the
traveling-salesman problem can be solved with a "good enough" solution because
the work required to find the best solution (if possible) has little benefit
over an easier to discover "good" solution.  However, the shortest-path problem
can be easily solved for the best solution.
