Suppose we are comparing implementations of insertion sort and merge sort on the
same machine.  For inputs of size n, insertion sort runs in 8n^2 steps, while
merge sort runs in 64n lg(n) steps.  For which values of n does insertion sort
beat merge sort?

for values of n where 8n^2 < 64n lg(n)
This is false when n equals 1 and when n is greater than or equal to 44 so
insertion sort is faster in the range [2..43].
