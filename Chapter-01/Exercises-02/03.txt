What is the smallest value of n such that an algorithm whose running time is
100n^2 runs faster than an algorithm whose running time is 2^n on the same
machine?

when n = 14:
100n^2 => 100*14^2 => 100*196 => 19600
2^n => 2^14 => 16384
19600 > 16384
therefore at n = 14 the faster is 2^n

when n = 15:
100n^2 => 100*15^2 => 100*225 => 22500
2^n => 2^15 => 32768
22500 < 32768
therefore at n = 15 the faster is 100n^2
therefore n = 15 is the smallest value of n where 100n^2 is faster
