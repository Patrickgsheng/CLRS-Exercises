Give an example of an application that requires algorithmic content at the
application level, and discuss the function of the algorithms involved.

One example of a program that requires algorithmic content would be a video game
involving units that are told to move from one location to another with obstacles
between the locations.  This path-finding problem requires an algorithm that
evaluates the different routes and finds the best path from the origin to the end
point.
