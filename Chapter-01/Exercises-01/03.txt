Select a data structure that you have seen previously, and discuss its
strengths and limitations.

The linked list is a data structure with the strength of being easy to remove
and insert items  at arbitrary locations, but it is expensive to get the data
stored at a particular location (as compared to a traditional array).  The fact
that linked lists are connected by "links" rather than being stored sequentially
is what causes both this limitation and benefit.  By not being stored
sequentially insertion and deletion does not require the repositioning of other
elements.  This also means that to access a particular element requires more
than knowing its position; the list must be traversed to arrive at that location.
