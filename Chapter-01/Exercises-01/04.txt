How are the shortest-path and traveling-salesman problems given above similar?
How are they different?

The shortest-path and traveling-salesman are similar in that they both involve
a graph of vertices with differing costs associated with their edges.  They are
different in that they have different constraints on their favored paths.  The
shortest-path problem doesn't require visiting every vertex, the
traveling-salesman problem requires visiting each node.  An algorithm for either
could be applied to the same graph.
