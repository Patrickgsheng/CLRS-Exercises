Other than speed, what other measures of efficiency might one use in a
real-world setting?

Other than speed, a common consideration for algorithmic efficiency is space.
Algorithms that require less memory space to operate may be more desirable in
situations where memory is limited than faster algorithms that require large
amounts of space.
